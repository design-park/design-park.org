      <h1>Giftbox app</h1>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to design a giftbox app, similar to the
        French apps
        <a
          href="https://www.smartbox.com/fr/"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the Smartbox website in a new tab"
          >Smartbox</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://wonderbox.fr/"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the Wonderbox website in a new tab"
          >Wonderbox</a
        >, but with a redesigned user experience. This is a work in progress.
      </p>

      <h2>Specific problem to solve</h2>
      <p>
        Since gift box apps provide a wide variety of activity choices, users
        find it hard to select what they will do with the box. The existing
        filtering system that asks users to choose categories is too rigid to
        match the exact tastes of the users.
      </p>

      <h2>Proposed solution</h2>
      <p>
        It is possible to improve the user's experience for the selection
        process by asking them to answer a sequence of questions. Based on the
        answers they give, it is possible to narrow down the selection of
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The algorithm used to ask the questions could be similar to what the
        <a
          href="https://en.akinator.com/"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the Akinator website in a new tab"
          >Akinator</a
        >
        app uses. The goal for the algorithm is to roughly divide by half the
        number of activities that are left to choose from each time the user
        answers a question.
      </p>

      <h2>How is it different from filters?</h2>
      <p>
        While basic filters already exists in similar apps, the proposed system
        is better in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The selection process is interactive. In particular, the users do not
          have to choose themselves what to filter on, the algorithm can choose
          the best questions depending on the answers already given.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can answer in an ambiguous ways (eg. not sure, quite okay): it
          makes it easier to rank the options by giving points to the
          activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to ask questions that would not match any existing
          filters. For example, the question "Which one would you prefer among
          these two places?", would not only restrict the selection to
          activities in the selected place but would give bonus points to
          activities in similar places.
        </li>
        <li>
          The algorithm can be improved over time by using machine learning
          techniques. For example, it could learn which questions were the most
          relevant to select the activity that the users chose in the end and
          improve the sequence of questions. It could also make connections
          between types of activities that are different but enjoyed by the same
          type of people, and therefore suggest alternative activities even if
          they do not match the answers exactly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Possible monetization</h2>
      <p>
        Some companies could pay to have their activities featured in priority
        in the app. A limited number of activities could get bonus points in the
        algorithm, which would make them more likely to be selected (provided
        that they match the user's preferences to some extent). A "featured" tag
        could be added to these activities for more transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Companies could also make limited time offers to get their activities
        featured in a specific "special offers" section of the app.
