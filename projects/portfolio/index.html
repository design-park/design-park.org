      <h1>Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        This is the portfolio website which you are currently browsing. In this
        page I explain the general design decisions that I made and how I made
        the website responsive and accessible.
      </p>
      <h2>General design decisions</h2>
      <p>
        The general idea that I followed when I made the homepage of this
        website was that everything on the screen should be related. That is why
        each section has by default a height of 80% of the viewport height. The
        20% remaining are for the user to know that they can scroll down to see
        more content.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the hierarchy of the content clear, I used different colors for
        primary buttons, secondary buttons, section titles and subsection
        titles. I also added a shadow below the navbar when the user scrolls
        down to make it clear that the navbar is not part of the content.
      </p>

      <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
      <p>It works on mobile.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>I tried to make the website accessible using different methods.</p>
      <p>
        First, I used semantic HTML 5 tags when applicable to make the structure
        of the content clear to a screen reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, I checked that the colors that I used have sufficently high
        contrast ratios. I used the
        <a
          href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the WebAIM contrast checker in a new tab"
          >WebAIM contrast checker</a
        >
        for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, I made sure that the website is usable with a keyboard. I checked
        that all the links and buttons are reachable using the tab key. I also
        checked that the focus state is visible. In addition to this, I started
        the page with the navigation menu, allowing to quickly skip to part of
        the page that the user is interested in. Even in mobile display, this
        menu automatically shows when focusing its elements with the tab key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I used the <code>alt</code>, <code>role</code> and
        <code>aria-label</code> attributes to clarify the objective of some of
        the elements in the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        These efforts resulted in a WCAG 2.1 level AA compliance with the
        <a
          href="https://accessibe.com/accessscan"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the accessible.com accessibility scan in a new tab"
          >accessible.com scan</a
        >.
