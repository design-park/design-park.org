      <h1>Numbee</h1>
      <p>
        Numbee is an app to learn French numbers and how to use them in various
        situations. I made a prototype on Figma to show my vision for the design
        of the app.

      <h2>Home page</h2>
      <p>
        I thought it would be nice if users could search what they want to know
        about French numbers as quickly as possible in the home page. Therefore,
        I allowed the users to access the following three things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting an answer of how to read any number you ask in French</li>
        <li>Quick overview of French numbers from 0 to 100</li>
        <li>
          Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about how to write French numbers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the screen dedicated to the overview of French numbers from 0 to 100,
        I made it possible for the users to scroll both vertically (move by
        tens) and horizontally (move by units). It makes it easy for them to
        quickly find the number they want.
      </p>

      <h2>Classes page</h2>
      <p>
        In this page, users get lessons on how to read French numbers. I made
        two different tabs to differentiate two different kinds of lessons.
        Basic lessons simply teach how French numbers are counted, and advanced
        lessons teach how French people use numbers in various situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, users can access a lesson only if they have passed the
        quizzes of the previous ones. This is to help them in their learning
        journey.
      </p>

      <h2>Review page</h2>
      <p>In this menu, users can review what they have learned.</p>
      <p>
        I made “review last lesson” stand out so that they can review what they
        have learned recently before moving on to the next lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also added other effective ways to train such as “bookmarked numbers”,
        “random flashcards from 0 to 100” or “build custom quiz”.
      </p>

      <h2>Interactive demo</h2>
      <p>You can try an interactive demo of the app made with Figma.</p>
      <div class="cta">

          href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vmp41lddq7FxJaFggzvSpD/French-Number"
