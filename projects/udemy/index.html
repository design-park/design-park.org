      <p>
        I do not claim that these are original creations as these were projects
        given by the instructor to learn given concepts. I still list them to
        show what I learned in this MOOC.
      </p>
      <h2>First website</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to use basic HTML and CSS to create a
        website. In particular, positionning and layout (<code>display</code>
        and <code>position</code> CSS properties) were the main concepts to
        experiment with.
      </p>
      <div class="cta cta-secondary">
        <a
          href="firstwebsite/"
          class="button cta-button"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the website in a new tab"
          >Visit the website</a
        >
      </div>

      <h2>Tindog</h2>
      <p>
        With this project, I experimented with the Bootstrap CSS framework by
        creating a landing page for the website of a hypothetical Tinder clone
        for dogs.
      </p>
      <div class="cta cta-secondary">
        <a
          href="tindog/"
          class="button cta-button"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the website in a new tab"
          >Visit the website</a
        >
      </div>

      <h2>Dice game</h2>
      <p>
        Javascript was the main focus of this project. The goal was to create a
        simple dice game where two players roll a dice and the one with the
        highest number wins. It allowed me to experiment with DOM manipulation.
      </p>
      <div class="cta cta-secondary">
        <a
          href="dicegame/"
          class="button cta-button"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the website in a new tab"
          >Visit the website</a
        >
      </div>

      <h2>Drum kit</h2>
      <p>
        With this project, I experimented with keyboard events and audio
        playback in Javascript.
      </p>
      <div class="cta cta-secondary">
        <a
          href="drumkit/"
          class="button cta-button"
          target="_blank"
          aria-label="Open the website in a new tab"
          >Visit the website</a
        >
      </div>

      <h2>Simon game</h2>
      <p>
        In this game, the player has to repeat a sequence of colors by clicking
        on the corresponding buttons. The sequence gets longer after each
        successful repetition. This project allowed me to experiment with
        Javascript arrays.
      </p>
